## Outline

-   Introduction: What is the question you are trying to answer?

    -   Question: What pattern characteristics make a pattern popular on Ravelry.com during November?

    -   Goal: Create a tool which pattern designers can use to see what patterns are popular in November and what they could create.

-   Data: What is the dataset you are obtaining? How did you obtain it? What are the characteristics of the dataset?

    -   Dataset: Top 20 patterns on Ravelry.com each day between Nov 16 and Nov 25, missing Nov 24

    -   Used the Ravelry.com API package combined with the ravelRy package in R to pull the top 20 patterns each day

    -   Cleaned each dataset and created the columns Number_Of_Languages and Number_Of_Days_In_Top_20

    -   Binded all datasets

    -   Arranged in descending order by pull date and kept most recent entry for each pattern

        -   By doing this, I know that I have the most up to date number of likes for each pattern that made the Top 20 list multiple times

    -   Final dataset contained 76 unique patterns

    -   Final dataset columns used in Shiny app:

        -   Average_Difficulty_Rating: a numeric variable, average user difficulty rating between 1 and 5

        -   Average_Rating: a numeric variable, average user rating between 1 and 5

        -   Craft: factor variable, Craft type, Knitting or Crochet

        -   Free: factor variable, Free = pattern is free to users; Paid = users must pay to download the pattern

        -   Knitting_Needle_Size: factor variable, size of knitting needles needed for the pattern

        -   Number_of_Favorites: numeric variable, number of favorites on the pattern on it's most recent day in the Top 20 in the dataset

        -   Number_of_Languages: factor variable, generated by programmer, the number of languages that a pattern is offered in

        -   Number_of_Top_20_Appearances: numeric variable, generated by programmer, the number of times the pattern appeared in the original merged dataset

        -   Pattern_Category: categorical variable, category of craft type (ex. pullover, mittins)

        -   Pattern_Parent_Category: categorical variable, high-level category of craft type (ex. sweater, hands)

        -   Pattern_Grandparent_Category: categorical variable, highest-level category of craft type (ex. clothing, accessories)

        -   Yarn_Weight: categorical variable, weight of yarn needed for the pattern

    -   Columns not used in Shiny app:

        -   crochet_hook: factor variable, TRUE: crochet hook is needed for the pattern. FALSE: crochet hook is not needed for the pattern. This was not used because only one pattern in final dataset was a crochet pattern and it was redundant with the `Craft` variable

        -   crochet_hook_size: factor variable, crochet hook size needed for the pattern. This was not used becuase only one pattern in the final dataset was a crochet pattern

        -   knit_needles: factor variable, TRUE: knitting needles are needed for the pattern. FALSE: knitting needles are not needed for the pattern. This was not used because it was redundant with the Craft variable

        -   name: project name. categorical variable, This variable was used clean the final dataset, but was not needed in the tool.

        -   pull_date: date variable, full date the pattern was pulled from Ravelry. This was used to clean the final dataset.

        -   pull_day: date variable, day the pattern was pulled from Ravelry. This was used to clean the final dataset.

-   Analysis: What is a visualization that helps answer the question? What other exploration did you do to answer the questions?

    -   Used Number_of_Favorites and Number_of_Top_20_Appearances as dependent variables and all other variables as independent variables.

    -   Variables did not reach the assumptions of normality, and so linear regression is not the best tool to determine if a pattern characteristic is a significant predictor of popularity.

    -   Out of curiosity, I did run some linear regressions. These were the significant results:

        -   I ran a linear regression with Average_Difficulty_Rating as the predictor and Number_of_Favorites as the dependent variable. The results indicated that Average_Difficulty_Rating was a significant predictor with a p value of 0.000145, and as difficulty rating increases, the number of favorites increases.

        -   I ran a linear regression with Average_Rating as the predictor and Number_of_Favorites as the dependent variable. The results indicated that Average_Rating was a significant predictor with a p value of approximately 0, and as rating increases, the number of favorites increases.

        -   All yarn weights were found to be significant predictors of number of favorites. Unlisted yarn weight was used as the baseline, and it was found that any other yarn type decreased the number of favorites on a project.

        -   Knitting needles size 2.5 were found to be a significant predictor of number of favorites at the 0.05 level. It was found that those size needles were expected to increase the number of favorites on a pattern.

        -   Number of languages was found to be a significant predictor of the number of favorites at the 0.05 level. As the number of languages a pattern is offered in increased, the number of favorites is expected to increase.

        -   Average difficulty rating was a significant predictor of number of appearances in the top 20 at the 0.05 level. As average difficulty increased, number of days in the top 20 was expected to increase.

        -   Average rating was a significant predictor of number of appearances in the top 20 at the 0.05 level. As average rating increased, number of days in the top 20 was expected to increase.

        -   Slippers as a pattern category was a significant predictor of the number of appearances in the top 20 at the 0.05 level. When a pattern was in the slippers category, the number of days in the top 20 was expected to increase by 8.

        -   Feet/legs as a pattern parent category was a significant predictor of the number of appearances in the top 20 at the 0.05 level. When a pattern was in the feet/legs parent category, the number of days in the top 20 was expected to increase by 8.

        -   Number of languages was found to be a significant predictor of the number of appearances in the top 20 at the 0.05 level. As the number of languages a pattern is offered in increased, the number of appearances in the top 20 is expected to increase.

    -   Because the variables did not reach the assumptions necessary to use the results of linear regression, I chose to make a Shiny app tool that would create bar charts that could be customized by users. Users would have the ability to choose between different independent and dependent variables in the chart to explore how different pattern features impact pattern popularity.

-   Conclusion: What is your conclusion based on your analysis? What are possible limitations of your analysis?

    -   Conclusions:

        -   Patterns with an average difficulty rating between 2 and three had the most favorites in my data analysis window. Unrated difficulty patterns had the most top 20 appearances in my data analysis window.

        -   Patterns with an average rating between 4.5 and 5 had the most favorites in my analysis window. Unrated patterns had the most top 20 appearances in my data analysis window.

        -   Knitting projects had the most favorites in my data analysis window, crochet projects had no favorites. Knitting projects had over 150 appearances in the top 20 in my analysis window, while crochet projects had less than 10.

        -   Paid projects had the most favorites and most top 20 appearances in my analysis window.

        -   Projects using knitting needle size 7 had the most favorites during my analysis window, followed by 2.5 and 8. Projects using knitting needle size 7 also had the most appearances in the top 20, followed by 4 and 8.

        -   Knitting patterns offered in four languages had the most favorites during my analysis window, followed by seven and ten. Knitting patterns offered in one language had the most appearances in the top 20, followed by two and four.

        -   Pullovers had the most favorites during my analysis window, followed by balaclavas and scarfs. These three categories also had the most appearances in the top 20, in the same order.

        -   The sweater parent category had the most favorites during my analysis window, followed by neck/torso and hat. These three parent categories also had the most appearances in the top 20, though the order was neck/torso, sweater, then hat.

        -   The accessories grandparent category had the mot favorites during my analysis window, followed by clothing and feet/legs. These three grandparent categories also had the most appearances in the top 20, in the same order.

        -   Projects using DK yarn had the most favorites during my analysis window, followed by patterns with the yarn weight unlisted and fingering weight yarn. Projects using DK yarn also had the most appearances in the top 20, followed by fingering and worsted weight yarns.

    -   Limitations: This is a very small window of analysis. The season and temperature need to be taken into account when looking at these results. It is likely that different types of clothing and accessories and types of fabrics will be popular depending on the season. This analysis also ignores pattern popularity on individual sellers websites and social media, and so it should just be viewed as an investigation into popularity on Ravelry and should not be generalized at this time.
